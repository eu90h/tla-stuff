This is a formulation of the third [Gossip Glomers challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/3a/). The idea is we have to share a list of seen values between N nodes. This spec demonstrates temporal properties: we express the idea that eventually all nodes should return the same view of the data. As written this spec. does no sharing of state so we can see how the temporal property is violated.
